# WHO_project
 A project which creates two different linear regression models to predict life expectancy based on the data provided by the WHO. One model which features as much data as necessary for model performance, and one which is restricted on the basis of what we evaluate to be sensitive data. The data spans 183 countries and records information between 2000 and 2015.
